# To Clarify
> To clarify my name is Sophia, but a multitude of people call me Soap, Soph, Sophie, or, very rarely, sushi. Unlike my name, I only have one dream and that's to be rich. Although not any type of "rich", I desire enough wealth to safely purchase the Pikachu illustrator card, worth approximately 3 million dollars. With only 39 maunfacured, its a rarity and an honor to own one. Aside frm this one dream, I work towards being a successful electrical engineer, and enjoy the beach and summer weather

## **Treasures**  
I value many things in life. Too many to count. From clothes to video games to _One Piece_. But the one thing reining above it all is not family or friends, but... my **Egyptian Mew Card**. Although it's dented, I still treat it with love and care. I even check up on it once a week or so.

## **Hobbies**       
I'm a woman of many trades. You need a poker buddy? I'm here. You need a volleyball partner? I got you. You need an artist? I exist. I love learning things and trying my best on them. Sports and Robotics are no exception either. I love playing sports for fun, or being active. Volleyball at the beach and simplyng running around chasing my niece  or playing tag are 2 ideal ways I exercise while keeping my sanity. On the other side of the coin, is meticulously constructing a metal moving object. The satisfaction and relaxtion I feel screwing in bolts in the right place all while listening to the greatest music alive (rock indie) is pure bliss. In the end,these hobbies are the things keeping  sane right now.
